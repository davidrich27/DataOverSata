DONE:
+ User Class
+ Account Class
+ Link Class
+ Transaction Class
+ Fee Class
+ UserAcctManagerTXT Class
+ DataManagerTXT Class

TO DO:
- ModelTXT Class

OTHER:
- Currently need to comment out import and packages to run unit tests (fixable?)
- Getting All Accts by User and All Transactions by Account are O(n) operations
- Generic Uniqueness Test doesn't search but iterates over all, so O(n) operation.  Could make function for each.
