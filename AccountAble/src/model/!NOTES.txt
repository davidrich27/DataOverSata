TO DO:
- Retirement methods for Model
- Make retirement/recovery tab
- CSS stylesheet
- Help Menu
- Forgot Password?
- Generate Reports in PDF
- Encrypt data

OTHER:
- Currently need to comment out import and packages to run unit tests (fixable?)
- Getting All Accts by User and All Transactions by Account are O(n) operations.  Will be O(lg n) with sorting can be binary search.
- Generic Uniqueness Test doesn't search but iterates over all, so O(n) operation.  Will be O(lg n) with binary search.
- Implementing BSTs (Hash Table) might be more efficient than ArrayLists
- Possibly make transactions write to different files for each account?

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Doesn't check for uniqueness when editing usernames and account names
- Doesn't update account totals after deleting transactions
